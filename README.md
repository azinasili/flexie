# Yoga
Yoga is a flexbox Sass grid library. Yoga is designed to be simple custom grid
solution for modern web layouts. The library does not include any browser
prefixed CSS by default.

## Installation
With [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azinasili/yoga):

```bash
npm install @azinasili/yoga --save
```

Install Yoga with [Bower](http://bower.io) package manager:

```bash
bower install yoga --save
```

Import Yoga into your stylesheet:

```scss
@import "path/to/yoga/yoga";
```

Itâ€™s not recommended to add or modify files so that you can update them easily.

### API
Yoga can be used to create basic bootstrap style grids using `@include yoga-container`,
`@include yoga-row`, and `@include yoga-columns` mixins. Yoga also includes mixins
for individual flexbox properties to create your own custom and semantic layouts.
Yoga includes [SassDoc](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc) to document function
and mixin uses. Open the `HTML` document in your browser to read about all of
Yoga's APIs.

## Bugs
Flexbox currently has some weird cross bowers bugs. A list of common bugs can be
found at [flexbugs](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs) repo. If there is an
issue with Yoga please open an issue with steps to recreate the bug.
